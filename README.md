### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Taildwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

I learned to configure the routes correctly in the relative way, routes that hosting like Vercel need a specific configuration so that you do not get the 404 error. Of course Firebase has a lot of functions, I would have loved it if it had the possibility of nesting objects in array of objects in your database, unfortunately I had to opt for localStorage to simulate the database
